/**
 * A complete, self-consistent agent module for a local database.
 *
 * The agent module cannot be understood from a static fixture. Commission is
 * settled when a job order is approved, incentives are awarded by a cron that
 * can only see progress accumulating across weeks, and invoices bill a calendar
 * week that has already ended and claim whatever the cron awarded inside it.
 * A dataset that just INSERTs rows into those three tables would be arithmetic
 * with no history behind it, and would not reproduce a single one of the
 * behaviours worth testing.
 *
 * So this seeder builds the estate and then RUNS THE REAL SERVICES over a
 * simulated seven-week timeline, travelling the clock with Carbon::setTestNow()
 * so each cron stamps the date it would actually have run on:
 *
 *     for each week 2026-07-20 .. 2026-09-06
 *         installs happen on weekdays, and each is approved the next day
 *         the incentive cron runs every morning
 *         the invoice cron runs on Monday, billing the week that just ended
 *
 * What comes out is a database whose agent_incentive_history, agent_invoices
 * and agent_invoice_customers were produced the way production produces them,
 * carrying real batch numbers, real carry-over, real claims and a real
 * one-week lag between earning an incentive and billing it.
 *
 *     php artisan db:seed --class=AgentModuleSimulationSeeder
 *
 * Destructive and idempotent: it clears the agent estate first, so running it
 * twice gives the same database rather than two overlapping ones. Intended for
 * a local simulation database only - it truncates users, applications and
 * job_orders.
