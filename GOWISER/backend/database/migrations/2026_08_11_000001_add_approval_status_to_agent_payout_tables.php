/**
 * Bring agent payouts onto the same approval workflow as transactions.
 *
 * Transactions are created as 'Pending' and only affect the account balance once
 * approved, recording the approver's email in `approved_by`. Agent payouts had
 * no status at all — they applied immediately — so this adds the missing status
 * column to both payout ledgers. The approver column (`approve_by`) already
 * exists on both tables and is reused rather than duplicated.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — existing rows are backfilled as 'Approved'.
 *
 * Every payout recorded before this change already moved the agent's balance at
 * the time it was saved. Leaving them 'Pending' would invite someone to approve
 * them later and deduct the same money a second time. Marking them 'Approved'
 * records what actually happened and makes them ineligible for approval.
 *
 * Guarded throughout: safe on a deployment whose tables were created by hand,
 * and safe to run more than once.
