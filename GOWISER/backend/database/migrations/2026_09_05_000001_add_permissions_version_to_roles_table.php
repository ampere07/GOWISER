/**
 * Which generation of the permission model a custom role was saved under.
 *
 * Until now a page key carried its buttons with it on most pages: holding
 * "plan-list" meant Add, Edit and Delete on the plan list, because those
 * controls had no keys of their own. They do now — "plan-list.create" and friends — and reading an
 * existing role strictly would revoke buttons from every role that has always
 * had them, on deploy, with nothing on screen to explain it.
 *
 * 0 — the row predates the per-action keys. App\Support\Permissions grants it
 *     every action key of each page in its LEGACY_GRANT_ALL_PAGES list that the
 *     role holds (the pages whose buttons were ungated for custom roles), and
 *     reads its stored sub-keys as written elsewhere, so nothing changes for it.
 * 1 — the row was saved from Role Management with the per-action checkboxes on
 *     screen, so its stored list is exactly what an administrator chose and is
 *     read as written.
 *
 * Existing rows default to 0. RoleController stamps 1 on every create and
 * update, so a role leaves the grandfathered set the first time somebody saves
 * it — which is also the first moment anyone has seen the new checkboxes.
 *
 * Guarded so it is safe to run twice, and on a deployment where the column was
 * added by hand.
