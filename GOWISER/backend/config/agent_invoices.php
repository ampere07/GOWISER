    |
    | COMMISSION is NOT configured here. It is earned per referral at the rate
    | on the referring agent's own record (agent_balance.commission), so the
    | invoice total is the sum across its customers. A team on one rate bills
    | customers x rate; a team on mixed rates bills each customer at theirs.
    |
    | That same rate is what each customer line states as its UNIT PRICE, so the
    | line items add up to COMMISSION exactly.
    |
    | TOTAL AMOUNT is the incentive, and it is NOT configured or calculated
    | anywhere in the invoice run either. It is read from the completed quotas
    | the incentive cron awarded inside the invoice's own billing week
    | (agent_incentive_history), and each one is billed exactly once. Whether a
    | quota was reached is the cron's decision to make, because only it can see
    | progress accumulating across weeks.
