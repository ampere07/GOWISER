 * documents. Dompdf returns the document as a string and it is uploaded from
 * there: nothing is written to this server, and `pdf_drive_url` on the invoice
 * is the only place the document exists.
 *
 * That is deliberate rather than incidental. storage/app/public is not reliably
 * writable by the web user — directories created by a CLI run belong to whoever
 * ran it — and an invoice that could not be opened because of a directory's
 * ownership is a failure with no good explanation for the person reading it.
 *
 * The PDF is uploaded once, when the invoice is generated, and the link is kept
 * on the invoice row. Opening the invoice hands back that link; it is rendered
 * again only when there is no link or the layout version has moved on.
