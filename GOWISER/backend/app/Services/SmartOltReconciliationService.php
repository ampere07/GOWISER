/**
 * SmartOLT inventory, optical-power and reconciliation engine.
 *
 * Ported from the standalone `smartolt.php` utility. Everything the standalone tool
 * kept in a private JSON storage folder now lives in two places instead: the ONU
 * inventory and status snapshots go into the framework cache, and long-running work
 * goes into `tool_jobs` so progress survives a page reload and can be polled.
 *
 * Credentials come from `smart_olt` via SmartOlt::first() — there is no settings
 * panel here and no second copy of the token.
 *
 * Endpoint note: the verified SmartOLT surface is
 *   GET  onu/get_all_onus_details            paged ONU inventory
 *   GET  onu/get_onus_statuses               bulk status/last-change
 *   GET  onu/get_onu_full_status_info/{id}   per-ONU detail incl. optical power + MACs
 *   POST onu/update_location_details/{id}    name / address_or_comment / contact
 *   POST onu/delete/{id}                     permanent unprovision
 * There is no `get_onu_optical_power` or `update_name` endpoint on this API; optical
 * power is read out of the full-status payload and renames go through
 * update_location_details.

     * same one and in the same order — bridge MAC to a live PPPoE calling-station-id,
     * that session's username to exactly one billing record — so a serial is only
     * ever written onto a subscriber the OLT and RADIUS agree on. Matching on the ONU
     * name was rejected for this pass: a misnamed ONU would write its serial onto the
     * wrong subscriber, and unlike a rename that is a change to a billing record.
     *
     * Direction is one-way. SmartOLT reads the serial off the device, so it is the
     * fact; `technical_details.router_modem_sn` is the copy that drifts when a modem
     * is swapped and only one system is updated. Rows already carrying the serial are
     * skipped, which is also what makes a second run in the same night a no-op.
     *
     * The only HTTP here happens while building the preview, before the loop. Each
     * write is its own narrow transaction inside the loop, so one refused row cannot
     * roll back the rest of the estate.
