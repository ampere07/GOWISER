/**
 * Closes a customer's open pullout service orders once their balance is settled.
 *
 * A pullout is raised to recover equipment from an account in arrears. When that
 * account pays up, the pullout is void — so it is marked Failed, on both the
 * support and the visit status, with a remark saying why.
 *
 * ── Why this class exists ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The rule previously lived twice, privately, in PaymentWorkerService and in
 * TransactionController, and both copies selected on
 *
 *     support_status IN ('in progress', 'reschedule')
 *
 * which matched nothing. On pullout service orders that column only ever holds
 * 'For Visit', 'Failed' or 'Resolved' — 'In Progress' and 'Reschedule' are
 * visit_status values. The rule had therefore never once fired, against
 * genuinely open pullouts.
 *
 * Both copies were also reached only from inside the RADIUS reconnect routine,
 * below four early returns — `already_online`, `no_username`, `no_plan` — so
 * even with the right filter, a customer who paid before being cut off (the
 * common case) would have been skipped. Closing a pullout has nothing to do
 * with whether RADIUS needed touching, so it no longer hangs off it.
 *
 * ── What it selects ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every service order for the account whose concern is "pullout" or "for
 * pullout", in any state EXCEPT:
 *
 *   • support_status = Resolved — the pullout was carried out. Rewriting that to
 *     Failed would erase a completed job, so those are left alone.
 *   • already Failed on both columns — nothing to do, and rewriting would move
 *     updated_at on every later payment.
 *
 * Rows part-way there (support Failed, visit still In Progress or blank) ARE
 * updated, so the two columns end up agreeing.
