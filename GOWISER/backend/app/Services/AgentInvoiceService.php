/**
 * AgentInvoiceService
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Builds the weekly referral invoice for every team and solo agent.
 *
 * An "owner" is whoever the invoice is addressed to: a team, or an agent who
 * belongs to no team. Agents are grouped by their `agent_id`, which is the team
 * they belong to on the `agents` table — an agent with none is billed alone.
 * A team therefore gets ONE invoice covering every agent in it, never one
 * invoice per member.
 *
 * A referral is billable when it was installed inside the billing week, on or
 * after the agent programme start date, and has not already been billed to this
 * owner. That last check is the important one, and it is enforced twice:
 *
 *   1. Customers already on an invoice for this owner are excluded up front.
 *   2. A unique key on (owner_key, application_id) refuses the write anyway.
 *
 * The second is what makes a repeated run safe. Two runs racing, a retry after
 * a timeout, or somebody running the command by hand on a Monday morning all
 * end the same way: one invoice, one row per customer.
 *
 * WHAT AN INVOICE IS MADE OF
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Two separate figures, worked out two different ways:
 *
 *   COMMISSION is per referral, summed across the customers on the invoice at
 *   the rate on each referring agent's own record. This invoice's own customers
 *   are what it is built from, so it is calculated here.
 *
 *   TOTAL AMOUNT is the incentive, and it is NOT calculated here. It is read
 *   from `agent_incentive_history` — the ledger the incentive cron writes when
 *   an agent completes a quota — taking only the quotas the cron awarded inside
 *   this invoice's billing week. An invoice for 10–16 August bills exactly what
 *   the cron awarded between the 10th at 00:00:00 and the 16th at 23:59:59, no
 *   matter how many times the cron ran in that week, and nothing from outside
 *   those bounds.
 *
 * The cron owns the question of whether a quota was completed, because only it
 * can see progress accumulating across weeks; a single invoice period cannot.
 * Each completed quota is then billed exactly once: claiming it stamps the
 * invoice's id onto its ledger rows, and the claim only lands on rows still
 * unstamped — so a quota already billed cannot be billed again, and two runs
 * overlapping cannot both take the same one. See incentivesForPeriod() and
 * claimIncentives().
 *
 * Everything for one owner is written inside a transaction, so a failure part
 * way through leaves no invoice rather than an invoice missing its customers —
 * and the incentive claim is inside it too, so an invoice can never be issued
 * carrying an incentive it did not successfully claim.
 * One owner failing never stops the rest of the run.

     * The incentive this owner earned inside this billing week.
     *
     * READ, NEVER RECALCULATED. The incentive cron
     * (AgentIncentiveService) is the only thing that decides whether a quota
     * was completed and what it was worth, and it already wrote that decision
     * to `agent_incentive_history`. This method's whole job is to find the
     * right rows and total them.
     *
     * Recalculating here — counting this week's billable customers and dividing
     * by the quota — is what this replaces, and it was wrong in both
     * directions. It lost every remainder, because a customer billed this week
     * can never be billed again, so an owner who installed 8 against a quota of
     * 10 bought nothing toward the next quota and would never earn an incentive
     * at all. And it paid quotas the cron had already paid, since neither knew
     * what the other had done. One source of truth removes both.
     *
     * WHICH ROWS. Three conditions, all required:
     *
     *   • `agent_id` is one of this owner's agents. A team invoice totals every
     *     member's incentives; a solo invoice is just the one agent.
     *   • `processed_at` falls inside the billing week, to the second. This is
     *     when the cron awarded the quota, so an invoice for 10–16 August takes
     *     exactly what the cron awarded between the 10th at 00:00:00 and the
     *     16th at 23:59:59, however many times it ran in between, and nothing
     *     from outside those bounds.
     *   • `agent_invoice_id` is NULL — not yet billed on any invoice.
     *
     * Only rows carrying `incentive_value > 0` are money: the cron records the
     * award against the one job order that COMPLETED each quota and 0 against
     * the rest of that batch. Totalling the column would therefore be correct
     * on its own, but the batch's other rows are collected too, because they
     * name the customers that earned the payout — and they are claimed with it,
     * so the whole completed quota is marked billed together.
