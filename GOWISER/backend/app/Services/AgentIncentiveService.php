/**
 * AgentIncentiveService
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Cron logic that awards quota-based incentives to agents.
 *
 * For each agent it counts the agent's countable Job Orders that have not yet
 * been counted, and for every full multiple of the agent's quota it pays the
 * configured `incentives_value` ONCE:
 *
 *     incentive earned = number of completed quotas x incentives_value
 *
 * A quota of 10 with an incentive value of 100 earns 100 per completed quota.
 * Reaching the quota is what earns the incentive; the referrals inside it are
 * what it takes to get there, not separately paid units. (Commission is the
 * per-referral part of the scheme and is unaffected by this.)
 *
 * Each full quota cycle is a "batch". An agent with 20 completed Job Orders and
 * a quota of 10 is awarded 2 batches in one run (10 Job Orders tagged to each),
 * and batch numbers keep incrementing per agent across runs (batch 1, 2, 3, …).
 * Any remainder (< quota) carries over unprocessed to the next run.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS A REFERRAL
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A Job Order counts when EITHER its onsite status is "Done" or "Completed", OR
 * its `pre_installed` column carries the pre-install marker AND it has not since
 * been abandoned. The second lets a referral earn quota progress once the site
 * has been pre-installed, without waiting for the technician to close the
 * install — the agent's part is done either way.
 *
 * The abandoned qualifier is what stops it paying for work that never landed: a
 * site pre-installed and then Failed or Cancelled counts for nothing, which is
 * how the rest of the scheme already treats it (commission needs the job order
 * approved; achievements and invoice lines need Done or Completed).
 *
 * That qualifier only decides what to count NOW, so on its own it never covered
 * the case where the site was still countable when the quota completed and
 * failed afterwards — the incentive was already paid. reverseAbandonedBatches()
 * closes that from the other end, undoing a completed quota once one of its
 * referrals turns out to have been abandoned.
 *
 * Counting early does not risk counting twice: a Job Order consumed by a
 * completed quota is recorded in `agent_incentive_history`, and the
 * `whereNotExists` below can never see it again — so its later flip to "Done"
 * picks up nothing.
 *
 * PROGRESS IS NEVER RESET BY A RUN.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A run does not "start a fresh count". It asks one question — which of this
 * agent's countable Job Orders are NOT yet in `agent_incentive_history` — and
 * that set only ever grows until a quota completes. So an agent on a quota of 5
 * who has Customer 1 and Customer 2 today still has both tomorrow, counted
 * toward the SAME quota, however many times the cron runs in between. Nothing
 * is discarded for want of a full quota; the run simply reports progress
 * (2/5) and awards nothing.
 *
 * When the quota does complete, the opposite applies and it applies
 * permanently: every Job Order that made up the completed quota is written to
 * `agent_incentive_history` inside the same transaction that pays it, tagged
 * with that cycle's `batch_number`. From that moment those customers are
 * consumed — the `whereNotExists` below can never see them again, so they
 * cannot be counted toward a second quota or paid a second time. Only
 * customers arriving afterwards count toward the next one.
 *
 * Only Job Orders onboarded on or after `config('agent.start_date')` are in
 * scope; anything earlier belongs to the period before the scheme and earns
 * nothing. Achievement progress uses the same date, so the two always agree
 * about which of an agent's referrals count.
 *
 * Idempotency / no-double-pay is guaranteed two ways:
 *   1. Only Job Orders absent from `agent_incentive_history` are counted.
 *   2. Every counted Job Order is recorded in `agent_incentive_history`, which
 *      has a UNIQUE key on `job_order_id` — so even concurrent runs cannot
 *      record (and therefore cannot pay for) the same Job Order twice.
 *
 * Job Order ↔ Agent association follows the project's existing convention
 * (see CommissionController): Job Orders are linked to an agent through the
 * related application's `referred_by` field.
 *
 * That field now holds the agent's user id for any referral made through the
 * "Referred By" picker, stored as the BARE NUMBER — `37`, not `agent:37`; see
 * AgentReferral::encode(). An id names exactly one account, so those referrals
 * are immune to the name collisions, renames and partial matches that the
 * full-name matching below could never resolve. No new column was needed: the
 * same varchar carries both forms.
 *
 * The cost of the bare form is that only its shape separates it from legacy free
 * text. AgentReferral::agentId() refuses anything that is not all digits and
 * refuses leading zeros, so "09077694575" and "000201" stay text — but a
 * historic referral recorded as a small bare number cannot be told apart from a
 * user id, and will be read as one.
 *
 * Older referrals are still free text — agent names, team names, and values
 * like "Walk in" — and are still matched by name, so both forms are queried
 * here and neither has to be migrated before the other works.

     * Undo completed quotas that contain a job order which has since been abandoned.
     *
     * A referral counts toward a quota as soon as its site is pre-installed —
     * deliberately, so an agent is not kept waiting for the technician to close
     * the install. The abandoned-status filter in the counting query is what was
     * meant to stop that paying for work which never landed, but it is a
     * point-in-time test: it only decides what to count NOW. It says nothing
     * about a job order that was countable when the quota completed and failed
     * afterwards.
     *
     * That sequence — pre-installed, cron runs, install fails — left the incentive
     * paid, and there was nothing anywhere in the module to take it back: no
     * negative rows, no reversal, no adjustment. In the simulation an agent kept
     * ₱500 for two referrals that both ended Failed, and it was billed to the
     * company on a weekly invoice.
     *
     * This closes it from the other end. Every run, before counting anything:
     *
     *   • find the recorded job orders that are now abandoned
     *   • take the whole batch each one belongs to — the quota was only ever
     *     complete BECAUSE of it, so the rest of the batch did not earn the award
     *     on its own
     *   • debit the award from the agent's balance and delete the batch's rows
     *
     * Deleting rather than flagging is deliberate: `job_order_id` is UNIQUE, so a
     * flagged row would block the still-valid referrals in that batch from ever
     * being counted again. Removing them returns those referrals to the pool,
     * where they belong — they were never the problem — and the abandoned one
     * stays out because the counting query still refuses it. The deletion is
     * recorded on the audit trail, so the ledger is not the only account of it.
     *
     * A batch that has ALREADY been billed is left alone and reported instead.
     * Rewriting it would silently contradict an invoice that has been issued, and
     * possibly paid; that needs a credit note, which this module has no concept
     * of. Naming it is the honest outcome, and the [REVERSED] tag survives the
     * cron log filter so it cannot go quiet.
