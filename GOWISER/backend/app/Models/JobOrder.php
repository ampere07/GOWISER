     * not paid yet, and nothing about generating a username says they have.
     * Creating the RADIUS user straight into its plan group would hand out full
     * bandwidth at the moment a technician filled in a form, which is why the
     * account is created here and activated somewhere else entirely.
     *
     * Activation is downstream and deliberate — ManualRadiusOperationsService
     * ::reconnectUser, called from the payment pipelines (PaymentWorkerService
     * and TransactionController) once money has actually landed. That call is
     * what moves the RADIUS user into the plan group.
     *
     * The string matches the RADIUS profile group name and the billing status
     * vocabulary the rest of the app compares against, so the same value is
     * correct on job_orders.username_status, technical_details.username_status
     * and in the RADIUS payload.
