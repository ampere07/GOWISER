 * route on the box.
 *

 * These status columns are free-text varchars written from several screens and two clients, so an
 * allow-list silently drops any spelling nobody thought of — and a badge that under-counts is
 * worse than useless, because staff learn to trust it. The terminal states are the short, stable,
 * well-known lists; everything else is by definition still open.
