/**
 * How a "Referred By" value names one particular agent.
 *
 * `referred_by` is a single varchar on applications, customers and
 * service_orders, and it has always held free text: an agent's name, a team
 * name, or something like "Walk in" or "Neighbour". Everything that pays an
 * agent then had to guess which of those it was looking at, and matched a name
 * against the users table — which cannot tell two agents with the same name
 * apart, and silently pays whichever row comes back first.
 *
 * The picker now writes the agent's user id instead, so a referral made through
 * the UI identifies exactly one account and nothing has to be guessed. The id is
 * stored plain — "37" — in the same column, so nothing had to be migrated and no
 * second column was added.
 *
 * A NUMBER IS NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE IT AN ID.
 *
 * The column already holds free text that is entirely digits: mobile numbers
 * typed into the box, account numbers like "20220006245", and bare numbers such
 * as "1840" that sit squarely in user-id range. So a numeric value only counts
 * as a referral when it resolves to a user who is an AGENT — see agentIdIfAgent()
 * and the role test in prime(). A number that resolves to nobody, or to somebody who
 * is not an agent, is left alone and displayed exactly as stored.
 *
 * That guard is narrow, not absolute: a legacy value that happens to equal the
 * id of a real agent account is indistinguishable from a referral to them. Three
 * values in the current data sit in agent-id range — "000201", "699" and "1840"
 * — and are worth checking if a referral ever shows the wrong name.
 *
 * Everything non-numeric is left exactly as it was and still goes through the
 * tolerant name match in AgentProgramme::referralBelongsToAgent(), so legacy
 * referrals keep resolving the way they always have.
 *
 * The clients carry the same rules in agentReferral.ts, so all of them agree
 * about what a referral says.
