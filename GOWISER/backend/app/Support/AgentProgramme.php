     * checked first and nothing else is consulted. Passing $agentId is what
     * lets a caller take that path — without it a numeric referral can only
     * ever be rejected, because it carries none of the agent's name.
     *
     * Older referrals are free text, so that match has to stay tolerant: every
     * word of the agent's name must appear in the referral, which accepts
     * "John Rusell Ampere" for an account named "John Ampere" while still
     * rejecting an unrelated name. An exact email match is accepted too.
     *
     * A NUMERIC referral never falls back to the name match, even when it is
     * not this agent's id — a number is not a name, and letting it reach the
     * tolerant branch could only ever produce a wrong answer. The "is it really
     * an agent" test AgentReferral applies for display is implicit here: every
     * caller takes $agentId off an agent roster, so an id that equals it is an
     * agent's by construction and a legacy number that matches no agent's id
     * falls out as unmatched — which is what it was before.
     *
     * Lives here because incentives, achievements and invoices all have to
     * agree about whose referral a customer is — a team invoice attributing a
     * customer to the wrong member would be visible on the document.
     *
     * The web and mobile apps carry the same rule in agentReferral.ts, and a
     * simulation checks all three still agree.
