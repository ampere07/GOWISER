/**
 * Per-user View Options: how a list is grouped, how it is sorted, and what colour
 * each distinct value wears.
 *
 * The AppSheet model, applied to SYNC's list screens. A screen ships with one grouping
 * decided in code, and that decision is wrong for most of the people using it: a
 * dispatcher wants Job Orders by City then Barangay, a supervisor wants them by
 * Technician then Status, and a collections clerk wants them by Billing Status alone.
 * Rather than guess, the grouping becomes the operator's to define — one to N levels,
 * over any column the screen declares as groupable.
 *
 * Sibling of statusSliceService, and deliberately a separate preference key.
 * The curated status slices are a *vocabulary* the server owns; grouping is an
 * arbitrary hierarchy the operator builds over columns. Storing them together would
 * mean reconfiguring one silently reset the other.
 *
 * Storage is the existing user-preferences pair, so a layout follows an operator to
 * another browser, and localStorage keeps it working on a host where the endpoint is
 * unreachable. Nothing here is load-bearing: a configuration that cannot be read
 * leaves the screen ungrouped, which is exactly what it showed before this existed.
