// One way to ask "may this user do X?" anywhere in the app.
//
// Before this, roughly a dozen pages and detail panes each carried their own
// copy of:
//
//   const hasPermission = (p) => isAdmin ? true : userPermissions.includes(p)
//
// along with its own localStorage read and its own three-way parse of the
// permissions field. They disagreed in one important way: a seeded role has no
// stored permissions array, so every one of those copies returned false for a
// technician — which is why the technician's Done button did nothing. Resolving
// through config/permissions.ts instead answers from the role table for seeded
// roles and from the stored list for custom ones.
